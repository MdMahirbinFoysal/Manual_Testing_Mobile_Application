# Manual_Testing_Mobile_Application
**Get Personal Voicemail**
Main idea of the application is:

â€¢The application is designed only for the Android platform. The app allows user to record individual greeting messages (auto answering - message) and customize them for each contact or group in the phone when the user can not pick up the phone.

User can adjust the time and days when he is active for a greeting message, and accordingly appoint a contact or group to it. There is Quick Status - the short message (eg I'm at the meeting), which can be written for all (it is impossible to set the time and the recipients).User can make the service inactive in the settings (all greeting and status are inactive - it won't be played during an incoming call, but user can capture, edit, delete at the same time).
